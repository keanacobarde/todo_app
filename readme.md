 ##  🌸 TODO APP  🌸 
 This pre-work project utilizes Bootstrap CSS, basic HTML, and JavaScript to create a basic to-do list app in which you can add tasks that need to be done, mark them as completed, and create new tasks. Because we're focusing mostly on the JS engine, we're using Bootstrap (a CSS framework) to more readily create the styles. 

 ### 🌸 USEFUL GIT COMMANDS (IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE) 🌸

## DOCUMENTING 06/20/2021
The main idea for this class is to dynamically render HTML. You can't work ahead for everything. Absorb as much as you can. 

> Targetting items in the DOM
My idea - utilizing methods attached to the document object to attach functionality to the 'apps-todos' id. I wasn't sure how I'd represent the to-do items. 

Refresher Questions 
- What is the DOM? 
- What is an HTML element? 
- What are nodes? How do they compare to HTML elements? 
- Identifying what parent elements are and what child elements are. 
- Siblings are at the same level within the parent element. 
- Selector - to select elements on the DOM. You can use document.querySelector.
THIS is where you're starting to see some resistance. How are you going to work on that?
