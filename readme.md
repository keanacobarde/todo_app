 ##  ðŸŒ¸ TODO APP  ðŸŒ¸ 
 This pre-work project utilizes Bootstrap CSS, basic HTML, and JavaScript to create a basic to-do list app in which you can add tasks that need to be done, mark them as completed, and create new tasks. Because we're focusing mostly on the JS engine, we're using Bootstrap (a CSS framework) to more readily create the styles.
